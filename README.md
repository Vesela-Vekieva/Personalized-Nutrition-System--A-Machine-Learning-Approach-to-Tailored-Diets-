# Personalized Nutrition System: A Machine Learning Approach to Tailored Diets 
This repository contains the **machine learning part** of a Personalized Nutrition System. 
The model predicts an individual's **diet type** based on dietary habits and lifestyle factors. 
This part of the project focuses **only on the ML pipeline** â€” the data science preprocessing and cleaning are handled separately.

## Features
- **Diet-Type Prediction**: Classifies users into diet categories (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, omnivorous) based on lifestyle and dietary patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- **Modeling & Evaluation**:
  - Implemented **XGBoost** and **Random Forest**
  - Applied **cross-validation** for reliable performance estimates
  - Used **GridSearchCV** and **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, balanced accuracy, ROC-AUC
